	    <h1> What is a Capybara? </h1>
	    <p> A Capybara is the worldÂ´s largest rodent. They are as big as large dogs. Capybaras are from about 39 to 51 inches (100 to 130 centimeters) long and about 20 inches (50 cm) tall from foot to shoulder. They tend to weigh 60 to 174 lbs. (27 to 79 kilograms). They can live up to 10 years in captivity and 12 years in the wild. Capybaras are herbivores and only eat vegetation. They eat food like water plants, grasses, grain, melons, and squash. </p>
	  
	<p1> Capybaras are very sociable animals. A group of Capybaras normally consists of 10 of them. As crespular animals, Capybaras are most active during dawn or dusk. Sometimes, though, when capybaras feel threatened, they will be nocturnal, which means they will stay awake at night and sleep during the day. They do this so they can be protected against predators.</p1>

	 <h1> How do Capybaras live? </h1>
        <p3> Capybaras prefer large grassy areas of space. Several spaces of shelters to sleep and protect themselves. They prefer ranges of temputures between 15 degrees Celsius and 30. They love to live by areas of water, so make sure to supply that for them. Capybaras hate loud noises and disturbances and feel like it is a disturbance to them. To help this fear, make sure to have multiple hiding spots and places for them to feel safe.   </p3>
        <h1> What are Mud Wallows?</h1>
        <p4> Wallowing is the comfort behavior in which an animal rolls in mud piles. Capybaras benefit from mud piles in many different ways. The mud helps the Capybaras when they become overheated and overwhelmed. Coats of mud can also help Capybaras from biting insects and sunburn.   </p4>
